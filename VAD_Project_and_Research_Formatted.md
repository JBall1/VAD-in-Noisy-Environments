## Abstract

Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a pivotal role in numerous digital audio applications. Distinguishing speech from non-speech in noisy environments remains a challenge. This research aims to design an efficient VAD system that demonstrates high accuracy across various noise conditions.

## 1. Introduction

Voice Activity Detection, at its core, determines the presence or absence of human speech in an audio signal. Its applications span speech recognition, telecommunication systems, and audio compression. The need for a robust VAD system is accentuated in real-world scenarios where noise is omnipresent. This research delves into the design and validation of such a system.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Dataset
A dataset comprising clean speech, non-speech, and speech with various noise backgrounds is employed.

### 4.2 Preprocessing
Audio signals are resampled and segmented for consistent analysis.

### 4.3 Feature Extraction
Features like MFCCs, spectral contrast, and chroma features are extracted.

### 4.4 Classification
An SVM classifier is trained on the extracted features to differentiate between speech and non-speech segments.
