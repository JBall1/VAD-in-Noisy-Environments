## Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in Noisy Environments

### Term Project

#### 1. Focus: Speech
**Objective:** Develop a robust VAD system that can detect the presence or absence of human speech in various environments.

#### 2. Problem Statement + Literature Search
**Problem Statement:** Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is vital in numerous applications such as speech recognition, speech compression, telecommunication systems, and smart speakers. An efficient VAD system should distinguish speech from non-speech, even in noisy environments. The project aims to design a VAD system that maintains high accuracy across different noise levels and types of background sound.

**Literature Search:**
- **Basic VAD Techniques:** Energy-based, Zero Crossing Rate, Spectral Features.
- **Advanced VAD Techniques:** Machine Learning, Neural Networks.
- **Challenges:** Handling varying noise conditions, different speakers, and real-time processing.

**Key References:**
1. [A typical paper on basic VAD techniques.]
2. [Recent paper on neural networks for VAD.]
3. [Review paper on challenges in VAD.]
(Note: Actual paper titles and authors would be inserted if this were a real-world scenario.)

#### 3. Signal Analysis
**Dataset:** For simplicity, let's assume we have a dataset with clean speech, non-speech (like music, ambient noise) and speech with various noise backgrounds.

**Analysis:**
- **Spectral Analysis:** Understand the frequency components of speech and non-speech.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze the time-domain characteristics of speech, such as energy fluctuations.

**Code for Basic Signal Analysis:**
```python
import librosa
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a sample audio file
y, sr = librosa.load('sample.wav', sr=None)

# Plot the time-domain waveform
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.title('Time-domain waveform')
plt.plot(y)
plt.xlabel('Time (samples)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Plot the spectrogram
D = librosa.amplitude_to_db(np.abs(librosa.stft(y)), ref=np.max)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
librosa.display.specshow(D, sr=sr, x_axis='time', y_axis='log')
plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
plt.title('Spectrogram')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
